# FBI Gun Background Checks and US Census Data Analysis
## Project Overview

In this project, I analyze data from two datasets. The data of the first dataset comes from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). The NICS is used to check if a potential buyer is eligible to buy a gun. The data contains information about each transaction submitted to NICS by day, such as types of guns, permits, and so on.It is important to note that data do not represent the number of guns sold.
The second dataset comes from census.gov, and contains data about the population in the American states, as well as several demographic and socioeconomic data about it between 2010 and 2016.

In this analysis, I explore the NICS dataset to see the overall trend of the firearm background checks. It will be interesting to see which type of gun has the highest check or growth over the time. Also, I will explore the data by state, to see which one has the highest number of firearm background checks and for which type of gun, as well as which state has the positive, negative ,most and least change over the time. 
After this, I will combine the two data sets to explore which demographic and socioeconomic factors are associated with a higher demand on guns.

Here are the questions I tried to answer:

1. What is the overall trend of the firearm background checks ? What is the most popular type of gun per capita ?
2. Which state has the highest firearm background checks per capita ? Which state shows the most and least change in term of background checks per capita ?
3. What census data impact the firearm background checks per capita ?
